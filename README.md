# Node starter template

This is a starter template for node projects using `@std/esm` to enable `import` and `export` functionality on the fly and without the need of a compilation step.

With the onward progress of Node, many of the missing gaps filled with Babel are now filled. While Babel is a great project, the additional compilation step and debugging can be cumbersome. 

`@std/esm` bridges an important gap in Node and the evolving JavaScript language--modules. This starter is a quick and easy way to start a Node project using `@std/esm`. It includes useful tools for testing and debugging as well.

# Testing with Ava

This starter includes Ava and configures it to use `@std/esm` so that library files can be included into test using `import` and `export` syntax.

# Debugging

This starter template also includes debugger configurations for use with Visual Studio Code.
